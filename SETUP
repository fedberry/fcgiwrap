Perform these steps after package installation:

1. Inspect the environment file /etc/sysconfig/fcgiwrap. Set fcgiwrap daemon
   parameters acording to your needs. See man fcgiwrap for details.

2. The systemd unit files provided with this package are instantiated and must
   be started by specifiying the desired web server user account. For example,
   when using nginx, the fgciwrap service is enabled then started like so:
      
      systemctl enable fcgiwrap@nginx.service
      systemctl start fcgiwrap@nginx.service
