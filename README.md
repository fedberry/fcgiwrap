## fcgiwrap

Simple FastCGI wrapper for CGI scripts

This package is considered temporary until the [fcgiwrap review request](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1645811) is approved and the pacakge makes it into the official Fedora repos.

Note that this package uses instantiated systemd unit files and must be started a little differently. See [SETUP](SETUP) for details.
